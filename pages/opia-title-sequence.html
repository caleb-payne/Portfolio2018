        <p class="pmod-body-copy">  
            <time class="expo-time">Summer 2015</time>Opia was a one-night art exhibition that raised money for Vision For The Poor, a local organization that provides sight-saving optometric care for children in impoverished countries. In addition to co-coordinating the event, I made a title sequence to recognize and thank the contributing artists.

        <h2 class="pmod-header">Objective</h2>
        
        <p class="pmod-body-copy">  
            I wanted to acknoweldge all the amazing people that lent their time and talent to our exhibition. We also needed a strong marketing piece that could be shared on social media to let people know what we were doing and intrigue potential visitors in the area.
        </p>
        
        <p class="pmod-body-copy">  
            The goal was to create a visually striking motion graphics piece that highlights each contributing artist while constructing an emotional narrative around the larger issue that Opia and Vision For The Poor are trying to address.

        <h2 class="pmod-header">Concept</h2>
        
        <p class="pmod-body-copy">  
            The overarching concept follows the sensory process of vision through the medium of children's artwork. The first few scenes depict light and color in the world, followed by refraction through the lens of the eye. The projector screen is a metaphor for the retina, and after that, I convey the functions of photoreceptors (rods and cones). The later drawings are meant to represent stages of visual perception in the brain.
        </p>
        
        <p class="pmod-body-copy">  
            As the sequence progresses, so does the picture on the page. As the music grows more anxious, the drawing begins to deconstruct. Then, the young artist seems discouraged, and by the end of the sequence the audience is confronted with the proposition that, hypothetically, he was never able to start drawing in the first place.
        </p>
