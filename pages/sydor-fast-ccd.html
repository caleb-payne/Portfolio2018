            <time class="expo-time">Spring 2018</time>As their website will tell you, <a class="pmod-ext-link" href="https://sydortechnologies.com/" target="_blank">Sydor Technologies</a> designs, commercializes and develops comprehensive solutions for defense, energy, particle accelerators, research, and other exciting scientific fields. They handle incredibly complex problems with the utmost&nbsp;precision.

            The Fast CCD interprets lower-frequency X-rays with excellent resolution and crazy high frame rates. This is a significant upgrade for researchers and will likely result in new scientific discoveries. As Sydor brought this technology into its final stages of development, they asked me to help them commercialize&nbsp;it.

        <h2 class="pmod-header">Approach</h2>
        
        <p class="pmod-body-copy">  
            As soon as we kicked off I needed to become acquainted with X-ray imaging, charge coupled devices (CCDs), and the beamline technology found at synchrotron particle accelerators. Sydor provided me with documents and other resources to facilitate my brushing up. They also provided the script to ensure the wording was correct, and we made tweaks back and forth to fit the video&nbsp;format.
        </p>
        
        <p class="pmod-body-copy">  
            I concepted visuals to support the script and produced a storyboard for the client's approval. After some brief design research, I cracked open Adobe Illustrator and got started on creating some assets. I saw the emerging style as a departure from the dryness of typical scientific presentations, but it needed to be true enough to the real science that I wouldn't end up offending anyone's sensibilities. The audience was assumed to have expert-level knowledge on the topic. As far as I know, this worked out&nbsp;fine.

        <p class="pmod-body-copy">  
            The final piece is a stylized jumping off point for scientifically-minded viewers to get excited about the hottest new X-ray detector on the market. If you regularly perform experiments in ptychography, coherent diffractive imaging, or perhaps 2D spectroscopy, hit me up!
