            <time class="expo-time">Fall 2016</time>When attracting applicants, private high schools invite 7th and 8th graders to shadow their students one-on-one for a day. This brings multitudes of nervous elementary school kids on campus to get a feel for the place and more comfortably address what might feel like the most important decision of their&nbsp;lives.
        </p>
        
        <p class="pmod-body-copy">  
            Following the success of a previous project we had done together, Mercyhurst Preparatory School asked me to create an updated video that they could show to prospective students on shadow&nbsp;day.

        <p class="pmod-body-copy">  
            I worked with the administration at Mercyhurst Prep to figure out a strategy that met their enrollment needs while allowing me to stretch my skills a little bit. Since it had been a few years since I attended MPS, we asked the english department to gather original works of poetry from the students themselves on the theme of being a Mercyhurst Prep&nbsp;Laker.
        </p>
        
        <p class="pmod-body-copy">  
            Leveraging these submissions, I wrote a script that embraced the challenges of high school and called out the benefits of a Mercyhurst Prep education. The story is told from a student’s perspective – a junior named Kelsey who is in the midst of writing a biology&nbsp;assignment.

        <p class="pmod-body-copy">  
            At the time of taking this job, I was extremely influenced by <a class="italicize pmod-ext-link" href="https://vimeo.com/35720685">Metamorphosis,</a> the award-winning homage that Buck created for Good Books. This film allows the commercial aspect to hitchhike in the backseat of a visceral narrative. That's what I aimed for – the magic of capturing an audience with&nbsp;a&nbsp;story.
